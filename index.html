	Web development governs all the code that makes a website tick. It can be split into two categories—front-end and back-end. The front-end or client-side of an application is the code responsible for determining how the website will actually display the designs mocked up by a designer. The back-end or server-side of an application is responsible for managing data within the database and serving that data to the front-end to be displayed. As you may have guessed, it’s the front-end developer’s job that tends to share the most overlap with the web designer. Some common skills and tools traditionally viewed as unique to the front-end developer are listed below:</p>

	<li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
	<li>CSS preprocessors (i.e., LESS or Sass)</li>
	<li>Frameworks (i.e., AngularJS, ReactJS, Ember)</li>
	<li>Libraries (i.e., jQuery)</li>
	<li>Git and GitHub</li>
</ul>
